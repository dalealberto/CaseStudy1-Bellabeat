## *Automate with Python*

### Impact:

I can now review the terms and definitions used in the course either alphabetically or in order of appearance.

### Context:

The document GDA_Course_1_Week_3_Glossary includes a cumulative list of all terminology learned up to this point in the course.

You may notice:
	- **Duplicate entries** of some terms across different course weeks.
 	- **Slight variations** in definitions as the course content becomes more refined.

Example:
	- Course 1 Week 1: "Data analyst: Someone who collects, transforms, and organizes data in order to drive informed decision-making."
	- Course 1 Week 2: "Data analyst: Someone who collects, transforms, and organizes data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making."

To avoid confusion and maintain clarity:
	- I’ve updated earlier definitions with the most recent and complete version.
 	- I’ve kept the original course/week label from when the term was first introduced.

Final Entry:
	- Data analyst: Someone who collects, transforms, and organizes data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive informed decision-making (Course 1 Week 1)

### Methodology:
1. extract the glossary from the Google Data Analytics course 
2. automate the process of writing which Course and Week the term was first introduced (Ex: adding 'Course # Week #')
3. sort either by:
	- phrase alphabetically ([Result](https://github.com/dalealberto/Case_Study_GDA/blob/main/GDA_Glossary_Sorted_By_Phrase.txt)) ([Python Code](https://github.com/dalealberto/CaseStudy1-Bellabeat/blob/main/Python/GDA_Glossary_Sorted_Phrase.py))
 
	- course week ([Result](https://github.com/dalealberto/Case_Study_GDA/blob/main/GDA_Glossary_Sorted_By_Course_Week.txt)) ([Python Code](https://github.com/dalealberto/CaseStudy1-Bellabeat/blob/main/Python/GDA_Glossary_Sorted_Course_Week.py))
